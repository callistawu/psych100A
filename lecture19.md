# Lecture 19 (Week 10, Wednesday)

## Sampling Distributions
* sampling distribution of b<sub>1</sub>
* could the value we get be generated from a DGP in which the value of b<sub>1</sub> = 0?
* scales: units in which b<sub>1</sub> are measured
* larger standard error = wider
* if it includes zero, we can't reject the null hypothesis

The null model can always be rejected if the sample size is large enough.
* if confidence interval keeps getting smaller and smaller, sampling distribution will get so narrow at some point that you must reject the null hypothesis
* you decide what amount of difference is significant

## Power and Type II Error
* **power:** probability that you'll reject the null hypothesis if the null hypothesis is not true
* must assume a Î²
* power + type II error = 100%

## Replication

## New Data Set
Mueller & Dweck (1998)
* interested in effect of feedback on willingness/skill to solve puzzles
* Raven's progressive matrices
  * what fits in the missing space to complete this pattern?
  * nonverbal measure of general cognitive ability/intelligence
  * randomly assigned 5th graders into 3 groups
  * **control condition:** nothing else
  * **effort condition:** "you must have worked hard at these problems
  * **intelligence condition:** you must be smart at these problems
* easy set > difficult set > new easy set

What outcomes might we be interested in?
````
head(sample(praisestudy,10))
````
* why might PSDIFF be a better outcome variable than PS3?
* equalizes differences between different groups

Look at effect of FEEDBACK on PS1 graphically.
````
tally(~FEEDBACK, data=praisestudy)
````
* 46 people in control, 38 in effort group, 39 in intelligence group
````
gf_histogram(~PS1, data=praisestudy, bins=9) %>%
gf_facet_grid(FEEDBACK~.)
favstats(PS1~FEEDBACK)
````

Write the model for PS1 explained by FEEDBACK using GLM notation.
* Y<sub>i</sub> = b<sub>0</sub> + b<sub>1</sub>X<sub>1i</sub> + b<sub>2</sub>X<sub>2i</sub> + e<sub>i</sub>

What does X<sub>2i</sub> in the three-group model?
* whether or not a particular subject is in group 3
* b<sub>2</sub> is the increment between group 1 and group 3

Fit the model of FEEDBACK on PS1.
````
lm(PS1~FEEDBACK, data=praisestudy)
````

What is the Effort group solving fewer problems correctly (on average) than the other two groups?
* could have been generated by the empty model
* use tools to evaluate this model to see if it could ahve been generated randomly

What are we hoping for in this model comparison?
* hoping to rule out the null model
* can we rull out that b<sub>1</sub> and b<sub>2</sub> are both equal to 0? 

How well does the feedback model fit the data?
````
supernova(lm(PS1~FEEDBACK, data=praisestudy))
````
* F = 0.568
  * less than 1
  * if no difference, it should be exactly 1 (model accounts for no variation)
* PRE = 0.0094
  * very low; less than 1% of the variation in PS1 is accounted for by our FEEDBACK variable
  * it should be low
* p = .568
  * if the true value of group difference is 0, then there is a .568 chance that we could have gotten the result that we got
  * we cannot rule out the null hypothesis
  * will go with empty model
  
Sampling distribution of F vs. PRE
````
fVal(PS1~FEEDBACK, data=praisestudy)
````
* F = .568
* this is the real F
````
fVal(PS1~shuffle(FEEDBACK), data=praisestudy)
````
* for sampling distribution F
* is different each output
* generating sampling distribution of F assuming there is no relationship between FEEDBACK and the outcome variable
````
SDoB1 <- do(1000)*fVal(PS1~shuffle(FEEDBACK), data=praisestudy)
gf_histogram(~fVal, SDOB1)
````
* do this 1000 times and save results in a sampling distribution
* look at distribution of Fs inside new data frame
* not normal, but looks like F distribution
* probability of observing an F out in the tail
* tells us probability that all the groups are equal
* random distribution of Fs if there is absolutely no relationship between the three groups
