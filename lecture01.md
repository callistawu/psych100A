# Lecture 1 (Week 1, Monday)

* **statistics** is the study of variation
* R.A. Fisher (father of design of experiments)


>"Robert Martin was laid off from his job at Westvaco, Inc. soon after he turned 54 years old. He sued for age discrimination.”
 
How do we evaluate his claim?
* the ages of other people who were laid off, the ages of people who weren't
* variation in all data

Two approaches
* what comes naturally: see the threat, find the cause
  * we're good at generating causal ideas, but we're not good at considering randomness
* statistical approach:
  * define a set of "cases" (e.g. all of employees and their ages)

Muller-Lyer illusion - Which line is longer?
* the lines appear to be the same size
* analogous to the situation with statistics
* statistics gives us a way of evaluating a claim
* **statistics is a tool to help us understand variation more clearly**


## Approach to the Course

Connections to Core Concepts
* DGP (data generative process) + data + sampling distributions > statistical model
* what is understanding? more connections

What It Takes to Understand
* for for deep learning, with understanding, students need recurring and sustained opportunities for:
  * **productive struggle** - with important mathematics
  * **explicit connections** - among concepts, procedures, problems, and situations
  * **deliberate practice** - increasing variation and complexity over time
* understanding, like skill, takes **deliberate practice**
  * complex concepts develop over weeks, month, and years
  
Practicing Connections: What connections to practice?
* core concepts (those that tie the whole domain together)
  * distribution triad
  * statistical model
* representations (that you can become skilled at using)
  * R
  * GLM notation
  * data visualization
* the world
  * the practice of data analysis
  * contexts in which statistics can be applied
