# Lecture 18 (Week 10, Monday)

## Sampling Distributions
* how extreme of an observed b<sub>1</sub> would cause us to reject the null model?
* arrange the sampling distribution of b<sub>1</sub> for SE=4 to represent the empty model
* what observed b<sub>1</sub>s would lead you to reject the empty model
  * empty model: centered at zero (Î²<sub>1</sub>=0)
* changing the sampling distribution of b<sub>1</sub> to SE=3 and 1 to represent the empty model
  * if in a study you observe b<sub>1</sub> = -6, what would you conclude?
  * how would changing SE affect this?
  * changing the SE changes the cutoff points

* if we reject the null model with a larger standard error, do we also reject it if the standard error were smaller?
  * yes
  * if SE gets smaller, assuming same b<sub>1</sub>, the peak gets lower
* if we fail to reject the null model with a larger standard error, would we also fail to reject it if the standard error were smaller?

* which of these would affect the width of a confidence interval?
  * level of confidence, sample size, standard error (width of sampling distribution), standard deviation of the DGP

The null model can always be rejected if the sample size is large enough.
* unless your b<sub>1</sub> is exactly zero, as your sample size gets bigger, you can always reject the null hypothesis
* why do we even do research then?
* just because you get p<.05 doesn't mean you've found something significant
* how big of a difference do you want to detect?
